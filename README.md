# Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting network intrusions using machine learning techniques.  
The system analyzes network traffic data and classifies it as normal or malicious to enhance cybersecurity.

##  Objectives
- To analyze network traffic using machine learning
- To identify intrusion attempts accurately
- To improve detection rate and reduce false positives

##  Methodology
The intrusion detection system follows these steps:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Model training
4. Testing and evaluation

Machine learning algorithms are applied to classify network traffic behavior.

## Dataset
The project uses the **KDD dataset**, commonly used for intrusion detection research.

- File: `KDDTest.csv`
- Source: Public benchmark dataset for network security research

##  Code
All implementation files are available in the `code/` directory.

Main features of the code:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training
- Prediction and evaluation

## Results

AI-based IDS models outperformed the traditional Decision Tree on the NSL-KDD dataset. Random Forest achieved the best results with *98.42% accuracy* and the lowest false positive rate (*1.58%*), followed by SVM. The results confirm the effectiveness of AI-driven intrusion detection systems.
